Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. Envelop the barbell with your thumbs for extra security.\nBring your shoulder blades back and draw your feet back and toward the bench, digging the balls of your feet into the floor.\nEngage your body, take a breath, and unrack the bar by extending your elbows. \nBring the barbell over your chest and take another breath.\nLower the barbell to your upper stomach, tap it, and press the bar up, bringing it over your chest again.

Your shins should be close to the bar but not in contact.\nBend forward and grab the barbell with a double overhand grip (palms facing back). Your hands should be shoulder-width apart, with your elbows a few inches from the insides of your knees.\nBring your shoulders back and lift your chest. Doing so will straighten your back, place your hips at the correct height, and bring your shins against the barbell. Set yourself to the barbell, don’t bring the barbell to your body.\nWith your body tense and arms straight, take a deep breath into your belly.\nPull the barbell forcefully as you dig your heels into the floor.\nExtend your knees and hips as the barbell travels in a straight vertical line and close to your body.\nSqueeze your glutes at the top to complete the repetition but don’t hyperextend your back, as doing so places unnecessary stress on your spine.\nHold the top position for a moment.\nLower the barbell in a controlled manner, making sure it descends in the same vertical line close to your thighs, knees, and finally––shins.\nSet the barbell on the floor as you exhale.\nRetract your shoulder blades again, take another breath, and repeat.', true, 'legs'),

Your feet should be hip-width apart with toes pointed slightly out.\nBend down and grab the barbell with an even, overhand grip. Your hands should be wider than shoulder-level apart, and your knees should be against the crease of your elbows. \nBring your chest out as much as you can to put your back in a safe, neutral position. Your hips should be slightly higher than your knees in this position, lower than they would be during a traditional deadlift setup.\nKeep your neck in a neutral position with your gaze directed a few feet in front of you.\nInitiate the first pull by deadlifting the barbell off the floor as you press your heels into the ground. Make the initial pull powerful because you have to generate some momentum for the next part of the lift.\nOnce the barbell travels above your knees, keep driving your hips forward as you begin pulling the weight in a straight vertical line. Maintain a neutral spine and keep your body upright. The entire sequence should happen in one smooth motion.\nAs the barbell travels up, squat, catch it, and have it land over your shoulders and upper chest. Maintain a firm grip over the barbell and keep your elbows pointing forward.\nAs the barbell lands in a front rack position, dip a few extra inches until your thighs are parallel to the floor and squat up to the top, straightening your knees fully.\nDip slightly and jerk the bar, bringing it over your head, and extending your elbows and knees. The motion is similar to a push press, but it requires a bit of extra momentum.\nLower the barbell to your shoulders and bring it to the floor while keeping your back neutral.', true, 'full_body'),

Your shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles should be in a straight line. \nWith your body tense and in position, lift one hand off the floor and bring it back behind your back.\nTake a breath and lower yourself by bending your supporting arm.
