You will need several boxes lined up about 8 feet apart.
Begin facing the first box with one leg slightly behind the other.
Drive off the back leg, attempting to gain as much height with the hips as possible.
Immediately upon landing on the box, drive the other leg forward and upward to gain height and distance, leaping from the box. Land between the first two boxes with the same leg that landed on the first box.
Then, step to the next box and repeat.

VALUES ('Box Squat', 'legs', '', '## Overview
The box squat allows you to squat to desired depth and develop explosive strength in the squat movement. Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.
Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.
With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.
Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.

Use your arms to grab the cable bar with a narrow to shoulder width supinated grip (palms up) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the top of your thighs. Your wrists should be hanging just beyond your knees.
Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Keep the contraction for a second.
Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling.
Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Adjust the seat so that your legs are only slightly bent in the start position. The balls of your feet should be firmly on the platform.
Select an appropriate weight, and grasp the handles. This will be your starting position.
Straighten the legs by extending the knees, just barely lifting the weight from the stack. Your ankle should be fully flexed, toes pointing up. Execute the movement by pressing downward through the balls of your feet as far as possible.

VALUES ('Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine', 'legs', '', '## Overview
Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance.
Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you without locking your knees. (Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

VALUES ('Calf Raise On A Dumbbell', 'legs', '', '## Overview
Hang on to a sturdy object for balance and stand on a dumbbell handle, preferably one with round plates so that it rolls as in this manner you have to work harder to stabilize yourself; thus increasing the effectiveness of the exercise.
Now roll your foot slightly forward so that you can get a nice stretch of the calf. This will be your starting position.
Lift the calf as you roll your foot over the top of the handle so that you get a full extension. Exhale during the execution of this movement. Contract the calf hard at the top and hold for a second. Tip: As you come up, roll the dumbbell slightly backward.
Now inhale as you roll the dumbbell slightly forward as you come down to get a better stretch.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Grab an exercise band and stand on it with your toes making sure that the length of the band between the foot and the arms is the same for both sides.
While holding the handles of the band, raise the arms to the side of your head as if you were getting ready to perform a shoulder press. The palms should be facing forward with the elbows bent and to the sides. This movement will create tension on the band. This will be your starting position.
Keeping the hands by your shoulder, stand up on your toes as you exhale and contract the calves hard at the top of the movement.
After a one second contraction, slowly go back down to the starting position.
