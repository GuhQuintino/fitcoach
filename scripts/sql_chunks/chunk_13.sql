Roller skating is a fun activity which can be effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular endurance. It requires relatively good balance and coordination. It is necessary to learn the basics of skating including turning and stopping and to wear protective gear to avoid possible injury.
You can skate at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes straight. If you want a cardio challenge, do interval skating — speed skate two minutes of every five minutes, using the remaining three minutes to recover. A 150 lb person will typically burn about 175 calories in 30 minutes skating at a comfortable pace, similar to brisk walking.

VALUES ('Sled Reverse Flye', 'shoulders', '', '## Overview
Attach dual handles to a sled connected by a rope or chain. Load the sled to a light weight.
Face the sled, backing up until there is some tension in the line. Take both handles at arms length at about waist level. Bend the knees slightly and keep your chest and head up. This will be your starting position.
Without flexing the elbow, pull the handles upward and apart, performing a reverse fly with some external rotation. Your palms should be facing forward as you do this.
Return to the starting position, taking a couple steps back to take the slack out of the line.

VALUES ('Sledgehammer Swings', 'abs', '', '## Overview
You will need a tire and a sledgehammer for this exercise. Stand in front of the tire about two feet away from it with a staggered stance. Grip the sledgehammer.
If you are right handed, your left hand should be at the bottom of the handle, and your right hand should be choking up closer to the head.
As you bring the sledge up, your right hand slides toward the head; as you swing down, your right hand will slide down to join your left hand. Slam it down as hard as you can against the tire. Control the bounce of the hammer off of the tire.
Repeat on the other side.

VALUES ('Smith Incline Shoulder Raise', 'shoulders', '', '## Overview
Place an incline bench underneath the smith machine. Place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the incline bench and make sure your shoulders are aligned right under the barbell.
Using a shoulder width pronated (palms forward) grip, lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with a slight bend at the elbows. This will be your starting position.
As you breathe out, lift the bar up until your arms are fully extended. Note: The contraction should be felt around the shoulders.
After a second pause, bring the bar back down to the starting position as you breathe in.
Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

VALUES ('Smith Machine Behind the Back Shrug', 'back', '', '## Overview
With the bar at thigh level, load an appropriate weight.
Stand with the bar behind you, taking a shoulder-width, pronated grip on the bar and unhook the weight. You should be standing up straight with your head and chest up and your arms extended. This will be your starting position.
Initiate the movement by shrugging your shoulders straight up. Do not flex the arms or wrist during the movement.
After a brief pause return the weight to the starting position.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions before engaging the hooks to rack the weight.

VALUES ('Smith Machine Bench Press', 'chest', '', '## Overview
Place a flat bench underneath the smith machine. Now place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the flat bench. Using a pronated grip that is wider than shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.
After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
When you are done, lock the bar back in the rack.

VALUES ('Smith Machine Bent Over Row', 'back', '', '## Overview
Set the barbell attached to the smith machine to a height that is about 2 inches below your knees.
Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up.
Now grasp the barbell using an overhand (pronated) grip and unlock it from the smith machine rack. Then let it hang directly in front of you as your arms hang extended perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.
Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
